Scripts for participants to hack on *(for {tknow})*

# Organisation of Code
Put the source files in the correct folder. Make sure code is commented well. If you think the intention of the program is obscure and inline comments won't suffice, make a `README` for your code.
Name the file in this format: `<src_file>_readme.md`.
We'll move it to the Wiki.
